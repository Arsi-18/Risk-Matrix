        <h1>Understanding Risks in Software Projects</h1>
        <p>In software development, risks are uncertainties that can affect the success of a project. Learning how to identify, assess, and manage these risks is crucial for project success.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Example Project: Simple To-Do List App</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The project is a simple To-Do List application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="header">Creating a Risk Matrix</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Hereâ€™s a simple example of a risk matrix for our To-Do List App:</p>

            </table>
            <p>The table shows a Risk Assessment Matrix, a tool for evaluating and prioritizing risks by categorizing them based on their likelihood and severity. The vertical axis represents likelihood levels (Almost Certain, Likely, Possible, Rare), while the horizontal axis indicates severity levels (Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, Severe). The intersection of these axes assigns a risk level (Low, Medium, High, Very High, Critical), with each cell containing examples of risks that fit the combination of likelihood and severity. For example, a security breach might be Critical (Almost Certain + Severe), while unforeseen bugs could be Low (Rare + Insignificant). The matrix is color-coded to visually highlight the most critical risks, helping teams prioritize actions and resources. This tool provides clarity by visually communicating risks, guiding teams to focus on urgent issues while monitoring lower-priority risks.
