        <h1>Understanding Risks in Software Projects</h1>
        <p>In software development, risks are uncertainties that can affect the success of a project. Learning how to identify, assess, and manage these risks is crucial for project success.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Example Project: Simple To-Do List App</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The project is a simple To-Do List application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="header">How to Understand Risks</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify Risks:</strong> List potential risks that could affect your project. These could be technical issues, resource availability, or external factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Assess Likelihood:</strong> Determine how likely each risk is to occur (e.g., Rare, Possible, Likely, Almost Certain).</li>
                <li><strong>Assess Impact:</strong> Evaluate the severity of each risk if it occurs (e.g., Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, Severe).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 class="header">Creating a Risk Matrix</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Follow these steps to create your risk matrix:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Draw the Matrix:</strong> Create a grid with likelihood on one axis and impact on the other.</li>
                <li><strong>Map Risks:</strong> Place each identified risk in the appropriate cell based on its likelihood and impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritize Risks:</strong> Focus on risks in the red and orange areas, as these are the most critical.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Hereâ€™s a simple example of a risk matrix for our To-Do List App:</p>
